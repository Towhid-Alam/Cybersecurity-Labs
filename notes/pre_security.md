## Topics Covered

### Offensive Security Intro & Defensive Security Intro
- Overview of the roles and approaches in cybersecurity:
  - Offensive security focuses on attacking systems to find vulnerabilities.
  - Defensive security emphasizes protecting and monitoring networks and systems.
- Careers in cybersecurity explained, highlighting the diverse opportunities available.

### Network Fundamentals
- Introduction to how computers communicate over networks.
- Understanding the core concepts of networking, including common weaknesses and how attackers exploit them.

### What is Networking?
- Networking is the process by which computers connect and communicate with each other.
- This module breaks down the complex subject into bite-sized, interactive lessons.

### Intro to LAN (Local Area Network)
- Explains private networks that connect devices within a limited area (like homes or offices).
- Covers technologies and design principles powering LANs.

### OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection)
- A fundamental framework that defines seven layers for how data is handled across networks:
  1. Physical
  2. Data Link
  3. Network
  4. Transport
  5. Session
  6. Presentation
  7. Application
- Helps in understanding where different protocols and technologies operate.

### Packets & Frames
- Data sent over networks is broken into smaller pieces called **packets** and **frames**.
- This division allows efficient and reliable transmission from one device to another.

### Extending Your Network
- Discusses methods to expand network coverage and connect multiple devices or networks securely.

### DNS in Detail
- The Domain Name System (DNS) translates human-friendly domain names (like `example.com`) into IP addresses that computers use to locate servers on the internet.
- DNS acts like the internetâ€™s phonebook, helping devices find and access websites and other online services quickly.

### HTTP in Detail
- Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the protocol used by web browsers to request and receive content from web servers.
- It defines how messages are formatted and transmitted, and how servers and browsers should respond.
- Understanding HTTP is essential for web exploitation and security testing.

### How Websites Work
- Websites consist of files and databases hosted on servers.
- When you visit a website, your browser sends an HTTP request to the server, which then returns the requested content.
- To exploit websites, understanding this request-response cycle is crucial.

## Key Takeaways
- Networking is the backbone of cybersecurity; understanding it is critical.
- The OSI model helps break down complex network interactions.
- Data is transmitted in small chunks (packets/frames) to maintain integrity and efficiency.
- Both offensive and defensive security roles rely on strong networking knowledge.
- DNS is a critical service for internet navigation, and its weaknesses can be targeted by attackers (e.g., DNS spoofing).
- HTTP is the foundation for web communication and a common vector for attacks like injection or cross-site scripting (XSS).
- Knowing how websites operate is the first step to finding vulnerabilities.
